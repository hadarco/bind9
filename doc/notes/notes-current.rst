Notes for BIND 9.17.11
----------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

- A new option, ``purge-keys``, has been added to ``dnssec-policy``. It sets
  the time how long key files should be retained after they have become
  obsolete (due to a key rollover). Default is 90 days, and the feature can
  be disabled by setting it to 0. [GL #2408]

Removed Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- If an invalid key name (e.g. "a..b") was specified in a ``primaries``
  list in ``named.conf``, the wrong size was passed to ``isc_mem_put()``,
  which resulted in the returned memory being put on the wrong freed
  list. This has been fixed. [GL #2460]

- If an outgoing packet would exceed max-udp-size, it would be dropped instead
  of sending a proper response back.  Rollback setting the IP_DONTFRAG on the
  UDP sockets that we enabled during the DNS Flag Day 2020 to fix this issue.
  [GL #2487]

- NSEC3 records were not immediately created when signing a dynamic zone with
  ``dnssec-policy`` and ``nsec3param``. This has been fixed [GL #2498].

- An invalid direction field (not one of 'N'/'S' or 'E'/'W') in a LOC record
  triggered an INSIST failure. [GL #2499]

- Previously, a BIND server could experience an unexpected server termination
  (crash) if the return of stale cached answers was enabled and
  ``stale-answer-client-timeout`` was applied to a client query in process.
  This has been fixed. [GL #2503]

- Zone journal (``.jnl``) files created by versions of ``named`` prior
  to 9.16.12 were no longer compatible; this could cause problems when
  upgrading if journal files were not synchronized first.  This has been
  corrected: older journal files can now be read when starting up.  When
  an old-style journal file is detected, it is updated to the new
  format immediately after loading.

  Note that journals created by the current version of ``named`` are not
  usable by versions prior to 9.16.12. Before downgrading to a prior
  release, users are advised to ensure that all dynamic zones have been
  synchronized using ``rndc sync -clean``.

  A journal file's format can be changed manually by running
  ``named-journalprint -d`` (downgrade) or ``named-journalprint -u``
  (upgrade). Note that this *must not* be done while ``named`` is
  running.  [GL #2505]
